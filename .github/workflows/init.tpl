Before you start creating a deployer, you need to set-up credentials. Let's start with creating a GitHub app, so you can get and set variables and credentials, create and update issues, and register a GitHub runner to deploy the SAP environment.

This app needs the following permissions only on **this** repository:
  - Administration: Read & Write
  - Environments: Read & Write
  - Secrets: Read & Write
  - Variables: Read & Write

1. [Create a new GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
  - GitHub App name: SAP Deployer
  - Homepage URL: @@REPO@@
  - Webhook active: No
  - Repository Permissions: Administration, Environments, Secrets, Actions
  - Click on `Create GitHub App`

2. Generate a private key
  - Click on `Generate a private key`
  - Save the private key in the [repository secrets](@@REPO@@/settings/secrets/actions) as  `APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - Save the App ID in the [repository secrets](@@REPO@@/settings/secrets/actions) as `APPLICATION_ID`

3. Install the app on the organization
  - Click on `Install App` and select the organization where you want to deploy the SAP deployment.
  - Select this (@@REPO@@) repository to grant privileges to the app.

  **Note**: If you don't have permissions in your organization, your organization administrator will receive a request to install the app.

When this is done, just close this issue and the next step will be created.
